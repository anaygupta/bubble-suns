            <p style="text-align: center;"> The Phoenix Suns were invited just to accommodate the Pelicans’ and their star rookie, Zion Williamson’s appearance in the NBA. 
                Our Suns were not supposed to be in the Bubble and everyone looked down on us. But something surprising happened. Something 
                not even the pundits could predict: the Suns rose every day for two weeks, just as consistently as the Sun itself and their 
                undefeated record shone just as brightly.</p>

            <p>Despite not having key players like Kelly Oubre Jr. and Aron Baynes during the bubble, the Suns were able to still display high-level performances against some of the NBA’s top teams. The Phoenix Suns came out of the bubble undefeated but was unable to make the play-ins due to unlucky circumstances.</p>
            <p>Without Oubre Jr., the Suns were missing out 18.7 ppg and 45% shooting from the field -- a key component of their regular season’s offense. The Suns also missed his big personality on the court as he would hype up his teammates and raise everyone’s mood.</p>
            <p>Without Baynes, the Suns were lacking an efficient back-up big center player that helped set screens, protect the rim, and get in the paint. As a large and physical player, Baynes would have provided a much-needed big for the Suns’ second and third rotations/lineups</p>

            <p><b><i>What were the biggest differences in the Suns’ playstyle, and who were their most influential contributors?</i></b></p>
            <p>Our team created this dashboard of visualizations as an story-told analysis of multiple comparisons of the Phoenix Suns’ 65 games before playing in the 2020 Orlando Bubble and the eight games they played in-bubble.</p>
            <p>We thought the most enlightening comparisons would be for the seven teams the Suns played both pre-bubble and in-bubble.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>The transition from the pre-bubble Suns going 26-39 to the in-bubble Suns going 8-0 was dramatic. But we believe the largest contributors to the bubble performance came from the Suns improving their rebounds, maintaining their high-assist play style, high free throw accuracy, and strong bench lineups.</p>
            <p><b>Rebounds:</b> In six out of their eight bubble games, the Suns improved their rebound counts from when they faced the same team during the pre-bubble regular season.</p>
            <p><b>Assists:</b> The Suns led the league with 27.2 assists per game. Coach Monty Williams has accredited this playstyle to the youth on the team and Ricky Rubio playing unselfishly.</p>
            <p><b>Free Throws:</b> Previously held by the 1989-1990 Boston Celtics with a free throw percentage of 83.19%, this season’s Phoenix Suns made 1,451 out of their 1,740 free throws, giving them an 83.39% free throw rating. Devin Booker was a big contributor in this area, shooting at 91.9% from the line, a league-best for the 24 year old.</p>
            <p><b>Turnovers:</b> The Suns have made significant improvements on ball handling and significantly reduced the amount of turnovers given to the opposing team. In six of the eight games, the Suns have shown how much better they are at handling the ball against NBA powerhouses like the Clippers and 76ers compared to before the Bubble.</p>
            <p>All in all, the Phoenix Suns have set themselves up for quite the return on December 12, 2020 against the Utah Jazz, and shortly thereafter the reigning champs from Los Angeles, the Lakers. With significant additions to the roster including maverick Point Guard, Chris Paul, the future seems bright as ever for the Suns.</p>
